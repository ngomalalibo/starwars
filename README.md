#starwars

I have also documented a few things here to help the understanding the code base and the use of the API.

The Star Wars API has been hosted on Heroku.

Its documentation can be accesses at https://mystarwarsapi.herokuapp.com/api-docs.html
To get started with the API do the following:

At the beginning of every class in the code base I have provided a /**commented*/ guide on its primary responsibility. This should help you understand the code base and my implementation.

I have not created any tests for the application due to the time constraints. However all requested features have been implemented.

I have used a remote MySQL database along with Spring Boot to implement this API. The MySQL database is on cloudclusters.net.
